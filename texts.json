  "Since words vary in length, for the purpose of measurement of text entry the definition of each \"word\" is often standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long in English, including spaces and punctuation. For example, under such a method applied to plain English text the phrase \"I run\" counts as one word, but \"rhinoceros\" and \"let's talk\" would both count as two. Karat et al. found in one study of average computer users in 1999 that the average rate for transcription was 32.5 words per minute, and 19.0 words per minute for composition. In the same study, when the group was divided into \"fast\", \"moderate\", and \"slow\" groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm, respectively. With the onset of the era of desktop computers, fast typing skills became much more widespread.",
  "JSON grew out of a need for a real-time server-to-browser session communication protocol without using browser plugins such as Flash or Java applets, the dominant methods used in the early 2000s. Crockford first specified and popularized the JSON format. The acronym originated at State Software, a company co-founded by Crockford and others in March 2001. The co-founders agreed to build a system that used standard browser capabilities and provided an abstraction layer for Web developers to create stateful Web applications that had a persistent duplex connection to a Web server by holding two Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connections open and recycling them before standard browser time-outs if no further data were exchanged. The co-founders had a round-table discussion and voted whether to call the data format JSML (JavaScript Markup Language) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), as well as under what license type to make it available.",
  "An async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object. Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new Promise which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function. Async functions can contain zero or more await expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of async and await enables the use of ordinary try / catch blocks around asynchronous code. Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The await keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular JavaScript code. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a SyntaxError.",
  "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows.",
  "We hope you have familiarized yourself with typing speed tests and have a good understanding of how they work. Now you will learn how to make one yourself. We call this \"foreshadowing\" in the business. In this coding task, you will create a Typing Speed Test app using JavaScript. The app will allow users to test their typing speed and accuracy by typing the displayed text within a given time frame. Users can then view their results and track their progress over time. You will design and implement a Typing Speed Test app that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. The app will retrieve text from a public API or a collection of text/words in JSON format in the project folder. In either case, text should be retrieved using the fetch API. The app will provide an intuitive interface to display the user's progress over time.",
  "JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).",
  "We've already explored event-driven programming, callbacks, and timers. These concepts form the foundation of asynchronous programming, which doesn't follow a linear sequence. Instead, it delegates tasks to other programs and keeps running. Once the other program completes its task, it informs the original program and returns the result. This approach allows JavaScript to execute tasks without blocking the user interface (UI); otherwise, the browser would freeze until the task is finished. A great example - including a while (true) {} in your code will make the page unresponsive even to clicks. In the callback section, we discussed how callbacks can be employed to handle asynchronous programming. However, callbacks aren't always the best solution. To simplify asynchronous programming, JavaScript uses Promises. A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.",
  "When is it appropriate to handle errors with try/catch? Generally, you should manage errors when you can address them effectively. If you do not try/catch them, the errors will bubble up to the caller function. When there is nothing you can do about the error, then you should let it bubble up. Once it bubbles up and no one handles it, you will see an error in the console (though there are some exceptions to this). What would be a good use case of handling an error? For instance, if you are fetching data from an API, you should handle the error if you want to display an error message to the user, because your user will not know that something went wrong otherwise.",
  "Variables and functions declared with <script type=\"module\"> will not be accessible from the HTML. If you want to access a particular value from the HTML document, you will need to assign it to the global window attribute to make it accessible. For example, if we have a function count, we would need to add window.count = count in the module. Then, the function can be accessed from the Console by typing window.count or simply count. Most of the time, const is the best choice for declaring variables. Use let only if you need to reassign the variable later. Avoid using var as it is an outdated method for declaring variables.  In JavaScript, functions in most cases are just like any other variable. They can be passed around, reassigned, extended with additional properties like any other object."
